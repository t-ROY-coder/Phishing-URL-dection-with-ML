# Phishing-URL-detection-with-ML
Detection of phishing URLs in python using Neural Network model

In this project we have taken the following steps to build a Machine Learning model which can identify phishing domains:
1. Collect URL data from various surveys and websites
2. Extract the features from the URLs and create datasets for both phishing and benevolent URLs
3. Mix and shuffle the phishing and benevolent URL datasets and split the mixed dataset into training and testing datasets
4. Create a Neural Network model with a particular set of hyperparameters
5. Train the model with the training data
6. Test the model with the testing data
7. Observe the loss and accuracy and improve the model hyperparameters accordingly
8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 with new model configurations
